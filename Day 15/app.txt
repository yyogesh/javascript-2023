1. Semantic HTML:
Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>) to provide a meaningful structure to your content.

2. Proper Document Structure:
Ensure a logical and hierarchical structure for your document.
Use heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) appropriately to create a clear outline.

3.Text Alternatives for Images:

Provide descriptive alternative text (alt attribute) for images using meaningful and concise descriptions.
For decorative images, use empty (alt="") or null (alt attribute not present) alternative text.
<img src="example.jpg" alt="A description of the image">

4. Semantic Forms:
Use semantic form elements (<form>, <input>, <label>, <button>) and associate labels with form controls.

<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">

5. Accessible Links:

Write meaningful link text that describes the link's purpose.
Avoid using "click here" or other generic link text.

<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example Website</a>

6. Keyboard Navigation:

Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form controls) are accessible via keyboard navigation.
Test your website's functionality using only the keyboard

7. Skip to Content Link:
Include a "Skip to Content" link at the beginning of the page to allow keyboard users to skip repetitive navigation and go directly to the main content.

<a href="#main-content" class="skip-to-content">Skip to main content</a>

8. Use headings to create a clear and informative hierarchy.
Avoid skipping heading levels.

9. Color Contrast:
Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background to improve readability.
Use tools to check color contrast ratios.

10. ARIA Roles and Attributes:
Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content.

<div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">This is an important message!</div>

Tables:

Use semantic HTML for data tables (<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <th>, <td>).
Provide appropriate table headers using <th>.
Testing:

Regularly test your website with accessibility tools such as screen readers and browser extensions.
Conduct usability testing with people with disabilities.
Responsive Design:

Ensure your website is responsive and provides a good user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
